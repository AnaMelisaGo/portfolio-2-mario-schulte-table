## What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?

Mario Schulte Table is a game website to train the brain. It is mainly used to upgrade the user's reading skills to a higher level. Exercises with schulte tables will improve peripheral visual perception that can be useful on a daily basis, most importantly in aiming speed reading.

### Functionality of Project

The goal of the game is not to get a high score nor to finish it in the least amount of time. It's aimed to widen the peripheral vision concentrating the eye in one single spot in the table. Just in the center of the table without moving the eye away from that spot.
