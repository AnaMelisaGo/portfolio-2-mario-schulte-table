## What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?

Mario Schulte Table is a game website to train the brain. It is mainly used to upgrade the user's reading skills to a higher level. Exercises with schulte tables will improve peripheral visual perception that can be useful on a daily basis, most importantly in aiming speed reading.

### Functionality of Project

The goal of the game is not to get a high score nor to finish it in the least amount of time. It's aimed to widen the peripheral vision concentrating the eye in one single spot in the table. Just in the center of the table without moving the eye away from that spot.

#### Design
 
##### 1. Font
The font used in the website is from Google fonts:
   * __Bungee__ for the heading
   * __Orbitron__ for the rest of the text to give it some vintage gaming vibes 

 
##### 2. Color Scheme
Basic colors are chosen for the website color scheme following the colors from the Super Mario games: red, blue, green, yellow, white and black.

##### 3. Logo
The chosen logo for this project is the main character from the Super Mario game, Mario himself. I added some more icon logos for the buttons of the main page of the game: the mystery box and the Super mushroom. I used digital illustration app to make the the logo.

I chose the main heading of the game as the home button to make it simpler.

##### 4. Geometry
 
The main purpose of the game is to force the eye to concentrate in one spot, which is the center of the table, so the game table has to stay at the center of the screen to focus the eye so the user doesn't get distracted by the background or any other element of the page. The background is from the Super Mario main setting. It wraps the whole table but is not stretched out to maintain the purpose of the game. Itâ€™s illustrated using a digital application, and the colors are softened up a bit so that it doesnâ€™t come into conflict with the foreground elements. 

 
##### 5. Wireframing
 
Bringing plans come into life using Balsamiq Wireframes.
