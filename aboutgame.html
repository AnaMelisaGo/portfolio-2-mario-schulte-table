                <h2>What is Schulte Table?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>It is a table with random numbers or letters used for brain training. There are different types of
                    schulte tables and they are mainly used to develop the speed of finding objects in a certain order
                    or style. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Exercises with schulte tables will improve peripheral visual perception, which is very useful on a
                    daily basis and most especially for speed reading skills. It is very useful for every users at any
                    age. For younger users it can be very beneficial in learning the proper sequence of numbers or
                    letters.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Brain training with schulte tables for the first time should be done gradually to have the best
                    result. Do not try to finish the game in the least amount of time. Instead, finish the game focusing
                    your eyes in the center without moving them away and search for the numbers with your peripheral
                    vision. Improvement will be noticed after a few weeks of training, like the ability to perceive
                    information, and increase in memory and concentration. It is a basic exercise to keep the brain in
                    good condition and to achieve the speed reading technique.</p>
